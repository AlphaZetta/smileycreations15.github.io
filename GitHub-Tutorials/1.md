### What is GitHub and Git?

#### What is Git?
Git is a version control software that allows you to track what changes are made to a file. <br />
When you create a Git repository, there is a branch called master. The master branch holds the main files. <br />
Think the master branch as the production branch. You can create different branches. Any changes made on one branch won't affect other branches. <br />
To create a git repository in the current working directory, you can type `git init`.
Git works in the Linux-macOS command line.
#### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based UI version of Git. In GitHub, Git is running in the servers in the background. GitHub also haves extra features like issues, pull requests etc. <br />
You can use Git and GitHub for lots of things. From creating software to writing poems. <br />
