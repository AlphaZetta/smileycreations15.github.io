<p>I have found the answers on this very useful and have worked through them.
I have exactly the same issue, unfortunately in my data the primary part of the array is seen as struct but the array beneath it is seen as string, so none of the functions such as from_json or explode work on this data.</p>

<p>here is an example of the data I'm working with
{"userId":"00001","eventId":"c530442a-c179-423f-a28f-254fc626ae8f":"[{\"field1\":\"someValue01\",\"field2\":\"someValue01\",\"field3\":\"someValue01\"},{\"field1\":\"someValue02\",\"field2\":\"someValue02\",\"field3\":\"someValue02\"}]"}</p>

<p>Ideally I want to write a new table where the first field is "eventId" followed by field1, field2 and field3, with all values for each common eventId.</p>

<p>Any advice on how to convert my additional arrays to sruct would be so helpfull.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
