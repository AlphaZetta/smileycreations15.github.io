Where is your logic for validating and submiting? Directly in the reducer?
Either do both things on the same action, or use a side effects library to do one after the other.
In any case, judging by the names of the actions, I don't see why you would use redux actions for that. Validating an input doesn't sound like a state change to me.
You should validate it with a simple function and depending if it's ok or not, act (with an action) accordingly.</p>
