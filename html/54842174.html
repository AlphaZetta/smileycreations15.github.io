The mat arrived with a StepMania CD setup but there is no wireless adapter with the mat. Not sure how to connect that. Any suggestions please?</p>

<p>By the way I have a generic wireless adapter for mouse, keyboard etc. Can that be somehow used with an appropriate driver so that mat can run?</p>

<p>I have two such wireless mats that arrived without wireless adapters and are lying dead as they don't connect to PC. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks.
