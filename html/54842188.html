  <blockquote>
    <p>I did some additional animation to show the user that rows are being collected under the finger using panGestureRecognizer and making a snapshot of the cell upon selection. &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>The first row dragged would automatically show a lift off animation and appear to be collected under the finger. When selecting subsequent rows, how did you manage to modify that previous row snapshot?</p>

<p>I'm using dragPreviewParametersForRowAt and it shows the snapshot for the first row dragged. I'm wondering, how I could change that snapshot when selecting subsequent rows. Your help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
