There is an xml editor <a href="http://www.ximple.cz" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XiMpLe</a> which contains a tool for splitting big files. Only fragment size is required. And there is also reverse functionality to link xml files together(!).
It's free for non-commercial use and the license is not expensive too.
No installation is required. For me it worked very good (I had 5GB file).</p>
